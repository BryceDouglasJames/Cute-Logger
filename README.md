## Project Structure

### [Record](#)


### [Store](#)


### [Index](#)
Indexes provide a way to quickly locate data within segments. An index entry will point to the location of data within a segment, significantly speeding up the retrieval of data without scanning entire segments.

Feature Considerations/Plans:

❌ Index Types: Support different index types (e.g., B-Tree Indexing, Bloom Filters) to optimize for various query patterns and performance needs.

✅ Memory Mapping: Utilize memory-mapped files for indexes to improve read performance, especially for large indexes. Currently being achieved by [this go module](https://github.com/tysonmote/gommap/tree/master)

❌ Dynamic Indexing: Allow dynamic index creation and modification to support evolving data structures and query requirements without significant downtime.

### [Segment](#)
These are typically larger blocks of data or files that store the actual data entries (e.g., log records). Segments help in organizing data in a way that is manageable and scalable, allowing systems to append new data efficiently and, when necessary, perform compaction or deletion on older segments.

Feature Considerations/Plans:

❌ Segment Compaction: Implement segment compaction to merge segments and remove redundant or obsolete data, optimizing storage usage and improving query performance.

❌ Segment Caching: Explore caching frequently accessed segments in memory to speed up data retrieval.

❌ Write-Ahead Logging: Consider integrating a WAL mechanism for segments to ensure data integrity and allow for recovery in case of unexpected failures.
